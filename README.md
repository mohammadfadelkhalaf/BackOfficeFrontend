   After installing the dependencies, type `npm run dev` to run the frontend project in development mode. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the project.

5. **Stop Current Execution**
   To run the project in a production environment, stop the current project execution by pressing `Ctrl + C` twice in the PowerShell window.

6. **Build for Production**
   Run `npm run build` to build the production environment. Once the build is completed, run `npm start` to start the project in a production environment.

7. **Open in Browser**
   Go to a browser and type `http://localhost:3000/` to see the project in a production environment.
